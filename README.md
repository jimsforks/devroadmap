rOpenSci Development Road Map

This document does not track every project/package within rOpenSci,
but rather the larger efforts we are undertaking.

Go to Issues/Milestones for each respective package to get up
to date information on issues and planned release dates.

All rOpenSci repositories do or will soon have notes on each
release in the `releases` tab for each repo.
