rOpenSci Development Road Map

This document does not track every project/package within rOpenSci,
but rather the larger efforts we are undertaking.

Go to Issues/Milestones for each respective package to get up
to date information on issues and planned release dates.

For past changes on a per pacakge basis: All rOpenSci repositories should
have notes on each release in the `releases` tab for
(e.g., [releases for rgbif](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/releases)). If
releases is missing see the `NEWS`/`NEWS.md` file in the repository.

## CRAN PACKAGES

 - [jeroen@berkeley.edu](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_jeroen_at_berkeley.edu.html)
 - [myrmecocystus@gmail.com](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_myrmecocystus_at_gmail.com.html) & [myrmecocystus+r@gmail.com](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_myrmecocystus_r_at_gmail.com.html)

### Magick and Image Processing

Jeroen working on new infrastructure for image processing and analysis in R.

 - ~Implement magick feature requests~ **complete**
 - ~Implement drawing system (perhaps via a graphics device)~ **complete**
 - ~Integrate with Tesseract~ **complete**
 - ~Blog post~ **complete**
 - Update latest libmagick++: Done but need to do again.
 - Refactoring documentation: **in progress**
 - To do: Extract image classes, make pkg more extensible
 - To do: Implement image analsysis tools

### Overdue Maintenance

 - CRAN has requested maintenance on the `brotli` package. Also the upstream library has had a lot of breaking changes in v1.0
 - ~The `tesseract` package seems broken all of a sudden. Probably breaking upstream changes.~ **complete**
 - The `RAppArmor` package needs cleanup now that most functionality has been extracted into `unix`.

### Tutorial / Playground

Ideas for the new website:

 - Create rOpenSci `rmarkdown` theme to generate rOpenSci tutorials as vignettes
 - Experiment with interactive tutorials (playground) for rOpenSci tools using new OpenCPU
 - Blog about `ropensci.ocpu.io` for remotely calling ropensci tools

### security

Improve security in R. We want to bootstrap a trust network based on the ropensci community to make it safer to install R packages from arbitrary sources (github, cran, etc). Git's ability to sign commits, combined with Github's GPG API and/or keybase for identifying peers.

* [gpg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gpg/vignettes/intro.html) needs work to support multiple keyrings.
* [notary](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/notary) developed at unconf17, experiment with a version of `install_github` that shows and verifies signatures.

Bob Rudis has a keybase package which interacts with the keybase API that we might borrow from. I also want to look into another approached based off letsencrypt.

* [openssl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openssl/index.html) needs a mainenance release to address bugs and features
* [jose](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jose/) implements Javascript Object Signing and Encryption based on `openssl` and `jsonlite` packages. Needed for letsencrypt client.
* `acme` is the protocol used by letsenrypt. It uses `jose` for signing and encrypting tokens. To get started I will implement a letsencrypt client for R (which also allows for further testing and developing `jose`). One that works, perhaps we can use the certificates for other purposes as well.

Also doing research into additional methods of securing R such as libcgroups and docker).

### http mocking/caching

__target date: August 2017__

`webmockr` mocks HTTP requests, and `vcr` is used mostly to integrate with unit tests to cache HTTP requests. `webmockr` is now on CRAN and improvements are being made. `vcr` is very close to a CRAN release.

* [webmockr](https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr) __now on CRAN__
* [vcr](https://github.com/ropensci/vcr) _close to 1st version on CRAN_

Both above will right away integrate with [crul](https://github.com/ropensci/crul) - but both will integrate with other http clients later (`httr`, `curl`, `RCurl`, etc.)

I will use `vcr` heavily in test suites in probably all the API wrappers I maintain. (and `vcr` depends on `webmockr`) - should see wide adoption outside of ropensci as there's nothing like these two out there currently.

### text mining

__target date: September 2017__

A few pkgs need updates, will try to organize releases to coincide + blog post:

* [fulltext](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext) - shooting for [milestone v0.2](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext/milestone/3) - lots of new things, demo abstract mining, full text mining, etc.
* [microdemic](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/microdemic) - new pkg to work with Microsoft Academic Search API
* [rcoreoa](https://github.com/ropensci/rcoreoa) - new pkg to work with CORE search API - also used in OpenknowledgeMaps
* [jaod](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/jaod) - new pkg to work with Directory of Open Access Journals API
* [crminer](https://github.com/ropensci/crminer) - new version to go out
* [rbace](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rbace) - new pkg to work with BASE search API - also used in OpenknowledgeMaps


### biodiversity data

__target date: October 2017__

Continual patch releases of these are put out, but targeting a grouped single date to release new versions of a suite of these pkgs:

* [rgbif](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif) - shooting for [milestone v1.0](https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif/milestone/10)
* [spocc](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc) - [milestone v0.8](https://github.com/ropensci/spocc/milestone/15)
* [ecoengine](https://github.com/ropensci/ecoengine) - @karthik maintaining - not sure if there's an obvious milestone that can be reached for this
* [scrubr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/scrubr) - [milestone v0.3](https://github.com/ropensci/scrubr/milestone/4)
* [mapr](https://github.com/ropensci/mapr) - [milestone v0.4](https://github.com/ropensci/mapr/milestone/5)
* [seaaroundus](https://github.com/ropensci/seaaroundus) - recently took this over - __pushing out a 1st CRAN version soon__
* etc... there are more



## Completed

### text processing and analysis

Lots of [suggestions](https://github.com/ropensci/textworkshop17/issues/5) from the textworkshop in London for wrapping new text processing libraries and utilities.

* [antiword](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/antiword/index.html) DONE: on cran
* [~dynamic topic models~](https://github.com/blei-lab/dtm): Started wrapping but turns out to be bad library. Discontinued.
* [bigartm](https://github.com/bigartm/bigartm)
* [compact language detector 2](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2) DONE: on cran
* [compact language detector 3](https://github.com/google/cld3) DONE: on cran
* [unrtf](https://github.com/ropensci/unrtf) Done: on cran

### taxonomy

`taxize` is our core taxonomy package that's been around for years, and is used widely. We're targeting a [v1.0 release](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/milestones/v1.0) for late in 2017, but will have a pre v1 for this target release.

* [taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize)
* [taxizedb](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/taxizedb) - use SQL dumps of taxonomic databases locally __ON CRAN__
* [binomen](https://github.com/ropensci/binomen) - dplyr like interface for taxonomic data __being merged with `taxa`__
* [taxa](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa) - classes for taxonomic data - in the future to be used by all other taxonomy packages __waiting on this getting to CRAN, should be very soon__ - co-maintiner and his PI and I writing a paper on this as well
* [wikitaxa](https://github.com/ropensci/wikitaxa)
* [ritis](https://github.com/ropensci/ritis)

### infrastructure

We are working on a new system for massively concurrent requests in `curl` to support high performance scarpers and crawlers. Because this is a big update, it needs a few more rounds of tweaking and testing and revision.

* [curl](https://github.com/jeroenooms/curl)

### system infrastructure

Jeroen is working on new packages `sys` and `unix` to improve interacting with low level system from R. This will make packages that require system calls more robust and easier to develop.

* [unix](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unix/index.html)
* [sys](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sys/index.html) (used by e.g `antiword`, `unrtf`, etc)

### geospatial

J and S are working on `geojson`, a pkg for geojson classes, which we can use in other packages. We can pair this release with `geoops`, a package to do geospatial operations without the gdal/geos stack, and a new version of `geojsonio`, our geojson I/O client. We could include new release of `geojsonlint` if appropriate. Perhaps throw in `wellknown` if I can get around to updating it.

* [geojsonio](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/geojsonio)
* [geojson](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/geojson)
* [geoops](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/geoops)
* [geosonlint](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/geojsonlint)
* [wellknown](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/wellknown)
* Implement `geobuf` format (binary geojson) in [protolite](https://github.com/jeroenooms/protolite) - this is now done âœ” - implementing now in the `geojson` package so users can optionally read and write geobuf format
